Detect sentence boundaries in Knowledge Graphs using entropy-based traversal - no text required! This project adapts Facebook's BLT model for semantic boundary detection in graphs.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install torch networkx nltk scikit-learn transformers
python -m nltk.download punkt
```
# Run the demo:
python kg_entropy.py

# ðŸ“Š Sample Output
Building graph from sentences: ['Alice loves Bob', 'Bob trusts Charlie', 'Charlie helps Alice']
Graph nodes: ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie']
Starting traversal from node: 'alice'
Entropy scores:
 alice: 0.4321
 bob: 0.3724
 charlie: 0.4084

=== Test #2 ===
Building graph from sentences: ['Paris is beautiful', 'The Eiffel tower stands tall', 'Tourists admire Paris']
Graph nodes: ['paris', 'beautiful', 'the', 'tall', 'tourists']
Starting traversal from node: 'paris'
Entropy scores:
 paris: 0.4448
 beautiful: 0.4854
 tourists: 0.4500

=== Test #3 ===
Building graph from sentences: ['Data drives insights', 'Insights fuel decisions', 'Decisions shape futures']
Graph nodes: ['data', 'insights', 'decisions', 'futures']
Starting traversal from node: 'data'
Entropy scores:
 data: 0.4101
 insights: 0.4100
 decisions: 0.5076
 
## ðŸ§© How It Works
1. Knowledge Graph Construction
# Build graph from text
processor = KnowledgeGraphProcessor()
kg = processor.build_graph(text)
Extracts Subject-Verb-Object triplets

Creates nodes with BERT embeddings

Connects entities with semantic relationships

2. Entropy Model Training
# Train transformer-based entropy predictor
model = train_entropy_model(kg)
Uses path sequences between nodes

Predicts semantic drift between sentences

Transformer architecture adapted from BLT

3. Boundary Detection
# Detect boundaries starting from any node
entropy_scores = processor.entropy_guided_traversal("prince", model)
Performs BFS traversal

Stops when entropy > 0.5 (boundary threshold)

Returns nodes with their entropy scores
